    text: `My experience with Liyana was very great. It's a dream come true for me to witness and be able to have  telemedicine center in Ethiopia. I was pleased from the first day of booking appointment, the tele-consultations, physical assessments of the mobile medical team to the conclusion of my services .This experience helped me to be cautious about my health conditions and nutrition. The center surely will help with reduction of the spread of Covid-19 virus by minimizing physical contacts. Keep all the good work up!`,
